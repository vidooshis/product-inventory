**Description:**
- I had mentioned some other port and was trying to open up another. My mac was hindering with one of the ports, so i could'nt access that port. CLI helped and identified the problem so then i changed the port to another.

**Description:**

**Desciption:**
- I had opened vite-project twice in different directories and both of them were conflicting with each other, gemini CLI helped in merging them both as i deleted one folder. It edited all the files containing 'client' folder configurations and changed them for frontend.
- It also changed tailwind config file along with package json files in the root folder.

## Conflict of Tailwind internal with system compatibilty

  - I had some internal issue which was hindering with tailwind. even though i had manually created the files all together, i still couldn't resolve this erorr. Even at the end, CLI couldn't resolve it so i had to remove taiwind files altogether and then i did it 'old way' using css creating classes for every component and adding it to external css file.

- When i was trying to connect the backend and frontend, i had some issue with naming port in different files and couldn't understand it at that time. so CLI helped me put it together and made it easy to identify my mistake without spending so much time
