**Description:**
- I had mentioned some other port and was trying to open up another. My mac was hindering with one of the ports, so i could'nt access that port. CLI helped and identified the problem so then i changed the port to another.

**Desciption:**
- I had opened vite-project twice in different directories and both of them were conflicting with each other, gemini CLI helped in merging them both as i deleted one folder. It edited all the files containing 'client' folder configurations and changed them for frontend.
- It also changed tailwind config file along with package json files in the root folder.
